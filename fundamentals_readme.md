## Now Platform overview

###### Define the Now Platform

The Now Platform from ServiceNow provides an Application Platform-as-a-Service (aPaaS). That means it is a cloud-based computing model which provides the infrastructure needed to develop, run, and manage applications. It is not limited to a specific department or function, but encompasses the entire enterprise.

The Now Platform from ServiceNow provides a modern, easy-to-use, service management solution in the cloud. It allows your organization to automate manual, repeatable processes, standardize service delivery, and focus on your core business.

ServiceNow provides all of this from a configurable web-based user interface built on top of a flexible table schema. The applications that run on the Now Platform use a single system of record and a common data model to consolidate your organization's business processes. Another advantage to this single system is that it can be leveraged to build custom applications.  

The applications delivered by ServiceNow are divided into four different workflows:



- IT Workflows

- Employee Workflows

- Customer Workflows

- Creator Workflows

There are many applications contained in each workflow. Want to learn more about these three workflows and all the applications they contain? Check out the ServiceNow web page below for all the details.


###### Identify the Now Platform architecture

The Now Platform architecture takes care of all your application infrastructure requirements, such as service availability, backups, and security. That allows you to focus on building, running, and managing great applications.

Select play on the video below to identify how the Now Platform architecture supports your infrastructure needs and gives you peace of mind. Use the Fullscreen option on the video toolbar for better viewing.

Management of all ServiceNow hosted instances, including upgrades, is performed using the Now Support (HI) (formerly known as HI Service Portal). The abbreviation HI stands for hosted instance. 

Want to get a quick overview of the Now Support (HI)? Check out the Now Support Portal video below.

Access to Now Support (HI) is typically reserved to a few team members at each site. A link to the Now Support (HI) homepage is provided below. It identifies helpful resources, such as contact information for ServiceNow Global Technical Support.

###### Now Platform interfaces

There are three ways to interact with the Now Platform. Each of the three approaches provides a different interface targeting different devices and purposes. All of these interfaces access the same single system of record and common data model of the Now Platform. The three Now Platform interfaces are:

- Now Platform user interface

- ServiceNow Mobile apps

- Service Portal

###### Now Platform UI

The Now Platform user interface is the primary way to interact with the applications and information in a ServiceNow instance. Notable Now Platform user interface features include real-time form updates, user presence, enhanced activity streams, and an application navigator designed with tabs for favorites and history.

Ideally, you should access the Now Platform user interface using your desktop or laptop computer through a web browser. Most major browsers are supported.

Want more information on the generally supported browsers for accessing the Now Platform user interface? Check out the product documentation below for details.

###### Service Portal

The Service Portal provides a user-friendly self-service experience, by providing access to specific features, using widgets. Users are able to:

- Search for articles, catalog items, records
- Submit requests
- Browse the corporate news feed
- And much more!

The Service Portal homepage can be accessed by navigating to https://<instancename>.service-now.com/sp. Your organization might have different ServiceNow instance environments for development, test, and production. Therefore, the <instancename> is the name of the specific ServiceNow instance you are connecting to for use. 

Both expert developers and beginners with the proper permissions can configure portals to create engaging experiences. Less technical users can make basic configuration changes to the UI, using Branding Editor and other components of Service Portal. More advanced users can edit and extend portals, pages, and widgets. Expert users can use the Widget Editor tool to write scripts to power a portal and even create rich web applications on the Now Platform.

Want to learn more about using the ServiceNow Service Portal to create engaging experiences? Check out the following resources to get started today.

###### Define the components of role-based access

The Now Platform utilizes role-based access to ensure people have the information and workflows they need to fulfill their roles â€“ no more, no less! It is crucial to protect sensitive data. Realize not every member of your organization needs access to all information at all times. 

To understand how role-based access works in the Now Platform, it is important to first define its components. Expand the sections below to identify the purpose of each component involved in the implementation of role-based access for the Now Platform.

- User
A user is an individual that has been granted access to your ServiceNow instance.

- Group
A group is a set of users who share a common purpose. Members of groups perform similar tasks or need access to similar information for various purposes, such as approving change requests, resolving incidents, receiving email notifications, or administering the Service Catalog. Users working in ServiceNow are typically assigned to one or more groups. 

- Role
A role is a collection of permissions in the Now Platform. These permissions define which applications a user or group will and will not be able to access within the system and which actions the user will be able to take on records within the applications. A role can be assigned to a single user or a group of users. Users and groups can be assigned more than one role.



A role can contain other roles. In the example below, the catalog_admin role contains the catalog and user_criteria_admin roles. If a user or group was assigned the catalog_admin role, they would be granted the permissions of all three roles.



Generally, when you think about your "role" in the workplace, you are thinking about your specific position or title, such as project manager, developer, or operations manager.  It is the part you play and job you perform every day. For the Now Platform, the word "role" defines your capabilities in the application. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between the different definitions.


- Base System Roles

he Now Platform includes many delivered base system roles, some are described below. For a complete list of base system roles, refer to ServiceNow product documentation for "base system roles". LEARN MORE >



- System Administrator (admin): Provides almost all roles and access to all Now Platform features, functions, and data (with some exceptions such as HR and Security Operations constraints). Grant this privilege carefully. Users holding the admin role can create and modify user roles, as well as impersonate other users. 

- Specialized Administrator (example: catalog_admin): Provides users with specialized administrator roles to manage specific functions or applications, such as knowledge base, human resources, reports, and web services. 

- Approvers (approver_user): Allows users to view or modify approval records directed to them.
- ITIL (itil): Can perform standard actions for an ITIL helpdesk technician. Can open, update, close incidents, problems, changes, configuration management items. By default, only users with the itil role can have tasks assigned to them.

###### Assign role-based access

Once a collection of permissions has been defined as a role, it can be assigned to a group or user. All groups or users assigned to that role are granted the access allowed by the role permissions.  


###### GOOD PRACTICE: Rather than assigning roles to individual users, add the users to a group and assign the role to the group. This method of role assignment simplifies maintenance when responsibilities within the organization change. A user can be removed from one group and added to a new group, inheriting all the permissions needed to the perform their new duties. 

###### User authentication

When you login to ServiceNow, user authentication is the first level of security applied. It validates the identity of a user who accesses an instance. Then it authorizes the user to access features that match the user's roles or job function.

To login to ServiceNow, navigate to the URL of your ServiceNow instance in your web browser. On the login page, enter your ServiceNow User name and Password, and then select Login.

Select play to find out how lists and filters give you the power to sort, analyze, and view information in the Now Platform. You got this!

###### Explore the power of lists and filters

Lists and filters help manage the records in a ServiceNow table. This includes task-based records that track the flow of work to completion, such as incidents.

Ready to see lists and filters in action? Select play to explore the power of lists and filters in the Now Platform. Use the Fullscreen option on the video toolbar for better viewing.

###### Natural Language Query (NLQ)

The Natural Language Query allows you to filter the list data using natural language, instead of the condition builder.
As you type, auto-suggestions for text will appear so you can click the suggestion before typing the complete filter.
Select Ask, and you will see the filter applied to the breadcrumb.

The Natural Language Query can be activated by installing the Natural Language Query (com.snc.nlq) and Predictive Intelligence (com.glide.platform_ml) plugins. Administrators will be able to turn this feature off by using the list control. Each NLQ result will be contained to the table the list is populated with data (ex. Incident). 

To turn this feature off, navigate to sys_properties.list, search for *nlq under Name. For com.snc.listv2.nlq.lists.append_query, set the Value to false. 

To learn more about the NLQ and activation information, navigate to ServiceNow Product Documentation: Natural Language Query


## Forms Overview

Welcome to the Forms Overview! In addition to learning how to view and edit records in forms, this overview will provide information on how forms can be configured to target different groups. Upon completion of this course you will be able to:

- Demonstrate how forms are used to capture information of one record on a table

###### Form layout and design

###### Configure forms for different audiences


## Task overview

###### What is a ServiceNow task?

A task is any record that can be assigned or completed by a user in ServiceNow. Users create tasks and are notified as the task moves along a workflow. Tasks can be assigned to specific users or user groups.

###### Why use tasks?

The power (and value) of tasks are that they are repeatable processes across the enterprise. By defining tasks, users with similar issues (for example, no network access) can have their issue automatically assigned to the appropriate user and assignment group. This results in quicker resolution times and minimizes the possibility of human error.

Not convinced yet? Select each numbered step below to explore a normal workflow in which the task is an Incident (no network access) and the users are Fred and Donna.

###### Time to dive a little deeper

The Task table is one of ServiceNowâ€™s core tables. It provides a series of standard fields available to other tables that define specific types of tasks (Incident, Problem, Change Request, etc.). In technical terms, these other tables extend the Task table.

- Approvals can be generated to a list of Approvers, either manually or automatically, according to approval rules. Approvals can be incorporated into workflows or can stand alone.

- Assignment rules can automatically assign tasks to users or groups, ensuring that tasks are handled by the most appropriate team members.

- Service Level Agreements can track the amount of time that a task has been open, to ensure that tasks are completed within an allotted time.

- Inactivity monitors ensure that tasks do not fall by the wayside by notifying users when tasks have been untouched for a predefined period of time.

- Workflow processes are specified by administrators and apply to tasks that meet certain conditions. After a task is created that meets the conditions, the workflow applies an automated process to the task.

###### Task assignment

There are four steps to assign tasks:

- Add users to groups
- Apply roles to groups
- Assign tasks to groups
- Assign tasks to users

###### Assignment rules

Assignment rules are used to automatically set a value in the Assigned to and/or Assignment group fields of a task record.

You can view assignment rules by navigating to the System Policy > Rules > Assignment module.

Create an assignment rule

Creating an assignment rule is a fairly straightforward process that can be done in a few minutes.

Select each numbered step below for more information on how to create an assignment rule.

###### Assignment rule criteria

An assignment rule must meet the following criteria to execute:

- The Task record has been created (or modified) and then saved on a form.  In the example you walked through above, a new Incident was created. Therefore, this criteria was met.

- The Task record must be unassigned (no values in the Assigned to or Assignment group fields). In the example above, the Assignment to and Assigned group fields were initially blank since a new record was created.

- The assignment rule is the first rule that matches the specified table and conditions. If more than one assignment rule matches the conditions, only the rule with the lowest Order value runs. Though not shown in the example above, the assignment rule had the lowest order value (100) for a Hardware Category Incident.

Additionally, assignment rules can be scripted, giving even more flexibility on the trigger and outcome.

###### Assignment lookup rules

Assignment lookup rules are another type of assignment rule. These rules only apply to incident records. They have fewer options than other assignment rules that can be applied to any task. They can be created by navigating to System Policy > Rules > Assignment Lookup Rules. 

If you look closely at Assignment Data Lookups, you can see that both Assignment Rules are displayed and Order values are 100. Even though the Order values are identical, this is not a problem because their Category and Subcategory conditions are different (Network - VPN vs Hardware).

###### Predictive Intelligence

Predictive Intelligence uses machine-learning algorithms to determine field values during record creation. Existing data records are required to "train" machine-learning to make effective decisions.

This results in improved efficiency and quality and reduces cost by:

- Reducing the amount of time spent resolving tasks

- Reducing the number of interactions required to resolve tasks

- Reducing the number of potential human errors that could occur while categorizing and assigning work

###### Visual Task Boards

Use Visual Task Boards to collaborate on tasks in real-time with group members, create personal to-do lists, and more. 

Visual Task Boards allow you to:


- Manage your tasks through a visual, drag-and-drop interface

- Identify process bottlenecks at a glance

- Track activity to view updates all in one place

There are three types of Visual Task Boards: Guided, Flexible, and Freeform.

- Guided boards can be created from a list and use the values of a specified field (e.g. State) as lanes. Tasks in the list are updated when cards are edited or change lanes on the Visual Task Board.

- Flexible boards are also created from a list, but lane changes do not update underlying task data.

- Freeform boards can act as your personal organizer to manage individual tasks of any kind. Lane changes do not update underlying task data.

Elements of a Visual Task Board

Visual Task Boards are displayed graphically as lanes and cards, and provide a landing page to view and organize work in ServiceNow. While Visual Task Boards may vary in their exact configuration, there are four elements common to each type.

- Taskboard Tools

- Quick Panel

- Lanes

- Cards

Select each marker below to learn more about each Visual Task Board element.

###### Taskboard tools

Taskboard tools are a critical part of a Visual Task Board. Take the time now to get familiar with the functionality they provided. 

###### - Guided Visual Task Boards

The lanes of Guided Visual Task Boards are based on the predefined values of a specific reference or choice field for a task. For example, the Guided board below was based on the Assigned To field for change request tasks. Therefore, its lanes correspond to specific users assigned to the change requests. Records in that list, which appear as cards, are modified when you edit cards or change lanes in a Guided board.

###### - Flexible Visual Task Boards

Flexible Visual Task Boards are also based on specified fields from tasks. For example, the Flexible board below was based on the Number field for incidents. However, since Number is not a reference or choice field with predefined values, a Flexible board is created with the default lanes shown here. Records in the list, which appear here by default as cards in the To Do lane, are not modified when you edit cards or change lanes in a Flexible board.

###### - Freeform Visual Task Board

Freeform Visual Task Boards are just what its name implies, freeform. Since it is not based on a record list, you can add task records and configure it however you want. The default lanes are the same as a Flexible board, but since it was not built from a record list, the lanes do not have any cards in them yet. You would add the cards yourself.


###### Reporting Overview

Using dashboards and reports

Create reports using the Report Designer

You know the information needed in your reports better than anyone! Ready to learn how you can build those reports yourself? 

Select play to demonstrate how you can:

Use the Report Designer to build reports

- 11Share and schedule your reports with others

- Generate reports from ServiceNow lists

- Add your reports to a ServiceNow responsive dashboard

When you report on a table (for example, Incident or Problem), information about the current state of platform data displays

Create management dashboards, report on KPIs and metrics, and increase quality and reduce the costs of service delivery using Performance Analytics.

Performance Analytics (PA) allows users to create dashboards with widgets to visualize data over time in order to identify areas of improvement. With PA, users can learn to identify the metrics that matter for business objectives, using out-of-the-box ServiceNow capabilities and content to address measurement and reporting scenarios. 

Unlike running a report in the Platform, developing and using an analytics solution is an ongoing and iterative process that users can improve over time. Review performance indicators, monitor metrics, and make improvements to organizational decision-making. 
    
- Widget: Saved view of indicator or breakdown



- Tables: Indicator Source - calculates scores



- Data Collector: Recurring jobs taking data snapshots



 - Dashboard: Custom arrangement of widgets



###### Knowledge overview

The value of Knowledge Management increases as users interact with it. Features such as rating content and submitting alternative solutions help others trying to solve similar challenges track down answers quickly.

Select play on the video below to discover the many ways users interact with knowledge articles to result in more valuable, targeted content. Use the Fullscreen option on the video toolbar for better viewing.


###### Identify the information to create a knowledge article

A knowledge article is a record in a knowledge base that provides information to knowledge consumers. Common examples of knowledge articles include policies, self-help tips, troubleshooting, and resolution steps. Groups like Human Resources often use knowledge articles to share information like company policies or benefits information. 

The following  options can be used to populate your knowledge base with knowledge articles:

- Create articles - Create articles using templates, and/or knowledge blocks directly in ServiceNow

- Create articles from cases or incidents - Allow agents and resolvers to quickly create and save knowledge to share with other users from cases in Customer Service Management applications or incidents in IT Service Management applications

- Import articles - Import Microsoft Word files into a knowledge base

- Integrate - Integrate to an existing, WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) compliant knowledge source outside of ServiceNow


###### Create articles from cases or incidents

If Knowledge-Centered Service (KCS) is used in your organization, agents and resolvers can create knowledge articles directly from cases or incidents. Using this approach makes knowledge a direct result of the resolution activities, instead of requiring a separate initiative.

Want to find out more information about using KCS with ServiceNow and creating knowledge articles from cases or incidents? Check out the product documentation provided below.

###### Import articles

Knowledge authors have the ability to import Microsoft Word documents directly into a knowledge base, select a category (if applicable), and determine whether they are ready to trigger the Publish workflow for the new articles. 


###### Integrate

ServiceNow also has the capability to integrate with WebDAV compliant knowledge tools, such as Sharepoint. Integrating with Sharepoint will allow documents within Sharepoint (or other WebDAV compliant sources) to appear in search results in ServiceNow.




## Flow Designer overview

###### What is Flow Designer?

Flow Designer is a non-technical interface for building and enabling process automation capabilities, known as flows. Flows automate business logic for a particular application or process such as approvals, tasks, notifications, and record operations. Flow Designer helps you build time-saving applications quicker.

###### When is Flow Designer used?

Flow Designer is a powerful tool, but it may not be suitable for all of your business needs. Before you learn more about it, select the tabs below to identify when to use and not to use Flow Designer.

Do use

- To orchestrate business processes across services with little technical user knowledge
- To reduce technical debt; meaning reduce scripting to simplify upgrades and deployments
- To integrate with 3rd party systems

Do not use

- Existing logic already developed using the ServiceNow workflow editor
- ServiceNow Instance is running Jakarta or prior

Real World use case

- Project manager has tasks automatically created and added to a Visual Task Board when a specific record is created
- Customer Service develops a flow to communicate incident resolution through the end-user support channel
- Change Manager creates an outage record and links it to an incident when the primary email server goes offline

###### How is Flow Designer accessed?

Since Flow Designer is separate from the Now Platform user interface, it opens in a different browser tab. On the Flow Designer landing page, tabs at the top list the existing flows, subflows, actions, executions, and help menus. You can create new flows, subflows, and actions using the + New button. To open a flow, select its Name. 

For this example, the VTB Sample Flow will be opened. When an incident is created with a Priority of 1-Critical, this flow creates a new freeform Visual Task Board and adds the incident as a card within the To Do lane. As you walk through this example, you will explore how the flow works. 

Each flow consists of a trigger and one or more actions. Select each of the three markers below for a definition of Flow Designer triggers and actions.

To open (and close) the Flow Designer help panel, select the question mark icon in the main header.  The help panel offers information about working with data and spokes, building actions and flows, and guided tours.

Next to the name for any action in the flow, select the Open help panel icon (?).   

###### Process Automation Design

With the Process Automation Designer on the Now PlatformÂ®, process owners are able to author cross-enterprise workflows within a single, unified process. Guide your end users and help them focus on tasks information that matters. 

The Process Automation Designer allows you to organize content built in Flow Designer and unify cross-enterprise processes. Benefits of using the Process Automation Designer include: 

- Connecting multiple flows and actions

- Guiding end users to complete a process in a task-oriented interface

- Consolidating separate business processes across your organization

- Defining a consistent record lifecycle from beginning to end

- Passing data between activities and stages of business processes

- Specifying the conditions and the order for activities and stages

- Visualizing and managing activities and stages in a Kanban-style board

NOTE: Familiarize yourself with any features that your business uses to automate operations on the Now PlatformÂ® (Flow Designer, business rules, and workflows). Doing so can help you avoid creating any conflicting logic in your processes. 

###### Flow Designer triggers
As previously mentioned, a trigger starts a flow when the conditions of the trigger are met. Triggers can be record-based, schedule-based, or application-based.

Trigger condition

Specific conditions can be set to identify when a flow should be instantiated by the trigger. The VTB Sample Flow example, uses a record-based trigger. It initiates the flow when a new Incident record is created with a Priority of 1-Critical.

Scroll through examples of schedule-based and application-based triggers below.  Take note of the different information specified for the three types of triggers (record, schedule, and application-based). 

Flow Designer actions

Actions are operations executed by Flow Designer, such as looking up a record, updating a field value, requesting an approval, or logging a value.

- Ask and Approval
Create approvals on any record, including rules for an approval, rejection, or cancellation, in addition to specifying a Due Date

- Create Record
Create a record on any table with configurable fields and field values

- Delete Record
Delete a record on any table

- Look up a record
Look up a single record on any table, confirming whether or not it exists. You can use the information from the record in subsequent actions within the flow. The record will be available for selection in the Data panel on the far right of the Flow Designer layout.

-  Look up Records
Who needs records when you have a band! You found another ServiceNow FLASHBACK!

This one dates back to 2016 when the ServiceNow company band, Zboot, played the Belly Up in Solana Beach, California. One of the early ServiceNow buildings even had a rehearsal space down in the basement for the band to jam. These days, you can groove with Zboot at Knowledge. They are always a big hit with the crowd.

You never know what you will find here on Now Learning. So keep hunting for more ServiceNow FLASHBACKS!

Pass data between actions

When designing a flow, you can use the results of an action as inputs for other flows, actions, or subflows. Use the sequence value shown in the corresponding section of the Data panel (Trigger, 1, 2, 3, etc.) to ensure you are using the correct data pill as an input value. 

Records shown in the Data panel can be expanded to show or select their corresponding fields. In the example below, the Incident Record in the Data panel can be expanded to select any of its fields for use in an action.

When a flow runs an action, it generates the data pill runtime value, which remains the same for the duration of the flow. For example, a data pill for [Trigger->Incident Record] always contains the incident record values from when the flow started.


When using the Data Pill Picker icon, use the arrow keys to dot-walk to fields in other tables. 

The example below begins with the Incident record Assignment group field. Then dot-walks to select the Assignment group Name from the Group table.

### Data Schema Overview

#### Tables and Fields

##### What is the Service Now Infrastructure

-  Tables: data structures which contains records.
-  Records: Data stored on tables, that contains fields.
-  Fields: Individual pieces of data stored in a record 

Tables can be accessed using the following modules within the Systems Definition Application: 
-  Dictionary: Defines every table and field in the system.
- Tables: Contains a record of each table in the database.
- Tables & Columns: Lists existing tables in the database.

##### Table Components

A table is a collection of records in the databse into which information can be entered.
- Each record corresponds to a row in a table.
- Each field on a record corresponds to a column on that table.

- Records are identified by a 32-character, globally unique ID, called a sys_id. Record numbers are automatically incremented, and the number format per table can be changed by visiting the System Definition > Number Maintenance application.
-  Fields store tha actual data. Availabe in types such as Choice, Date/Time, Journal, Reference, etc.

##### Field Attributes

Every field has 3 key attributes:

- Field Label: User-friendly term which allows people to identify the field in the user interface
- Field Name: A unique term that the system uses to identify the field. I.E. user_id.
- Value: The actual data.


##### Reference Fields

A reference field stores a unique system identifier (known as the sys_id) of a record on another table whic is what established the reference relationship.
When you define a reference field, the platform creates a relationship between the two tables. 

Reference Fields are identified by the reference look up icon.


#### Table Relationships

###### Table relationship

Tables can be related to each other in various ways

- One to Many
Within a table, a field can hold a reference to a record on another table. There are three one-to-many relationship fields:

Reference Fields - Allows a user to select a record on a table defined by the reference field. 
Glide List - Allows a user to select multiple records on a table defined by the glide list.
Document ID Fields - Allow a user to select a record on any table in the instance.

- Many to Many
Two or more tables can be related in any bi-directional reationship, so that the related records are visible from both tables in a related list.

- Database Views
Two tables can be joined virtually to allow for reporting on data that might be stored in more than one table

- Extensions
A table can extend another table. The extended table includes unique fields plus all of the fields and their properties from the parent table 

#### Tables Types

##### Extended tables


For tables that stand alone, only the global default fields are automatically created.

Extending a table incorporates all of the fields of the original table and allows for unique fields to be created on the new table. 

A table that extends another table is called a child class
The table it extends is the parent class

Permission to extend

A table's __Extensible__ field is used to control whether a table can be extended. 

__Dictionary ocerrides__ provides the ability to define a field on a child table differently from the field on the parent table.
If a table is exteneded but itself is not extending another table, it is called a __Base Table__. 
The __Task__ table is such a table, making it both a base class, and a parent class.

__Core__ tables are created by Service Now and provided with the base system.
__Custom__ tables are created by you


#### Schema Map

-  Schema Map: provides a graphical representation of othe tables related to specific.

##### To generate a schema map
