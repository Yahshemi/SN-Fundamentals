## Now Platform overview

###### Define the Now Platform

The Now Platform from ServiceNow provides an Application Platform-as-a-Service (aPaaS). That means it is a cloud-based computing model which provides the infrastructure needed to develop, run, and manage applications. It is not limited to a specific department or function, but encompasses the entire enterprise.

The Now Platform from ServiceNow provides a modern, easy-to-use, service management solution in the cloud. It allows your organization to automate manual, repeatable processes, standardize service delivery, and focus on your core business.

ServiceNow provides all of this from a configurable web-based user interface built on top of a flexible table schema. The applications that run on the Now Platform use a single system of record and a common data model to consolidate your organization's business processes. Another advantage to this single system is that it can be leveraged to build custom applications.  

The applications delivered by ServiceNow are divided into four different workflows:



- IT Workflows

- Employee Workflows

- Customer Workflows

- Creator Workflows

There are many applications contained in each workflow. Want to learn more about these three workflows and all the applications they contain? Check out the ServiceNow web page below for all the details.


###### Identify the Now Platform architecture

The Now Platform architecture takes care of all your application infrastructure requirements, such as service availability, backups, and security. That allows you to focus on building, running, and managing great applications.

Select play on the video below to identify how the Now Platform architecture supports your infrastructure needs and gives you peace of mind. Use the Fullscreen option on the video toolbar for better viewing.

Management of all ServiceNow hosted instances, including upgrades, is performed using the Now Support (HI) (formerly known as HI Service Portal). The abbreviation HI stands for hosted instance. 

Want to get a quick overview of the Now Support (HI)? Check out the Now Support Portal video below.

Access to Now Support (HI) is typically reserved to a few team members at each site. A link to the Now Support (HI) homepage is provided below. It identifies helpful resources, such as contact information for ServiceNow Global Technical Support.

## Now Platform interfaces

There are three ways to interact with the Now Platform. Each of the three approaches provides a different interface targeting different devices and purposes. All of these interfaces access the same single system of record and common data model of the Now Platform. The three Now Platform interfaces are:

- Now Platform user interface

- ServiceNow Mobile apps

- Service Portal

###### Now Platform user interface

The Now Platform user interface is the primary way to interact with the applications and information in a ServiceNow instance. Notable Now Platform user interface features include real-time form updates, user presence, enhanced activity streams, and an application navigator designed with tabs for favorites and history.

Ideally, you should access the Now Platform user interface using your desktop or laptop computer through a web browser. Most major browsers are supported.

Want more information on the generally supported browsers for accessing the Now Platform user interface? Check out the product documentation below for details.

###### ServiceNow Mobile apps

ServiceNow offers three, persona-focused ServiceNow Mobile apps:

- ServiceNow Agent

- Now Mobile

- ServiceNow Onboarding

These apps help agents and employees work more efficiently and productively on the go. Select the flashcards below to learn more about each ServiceNow Mobile app and its target audience.

These three apps can be downloaded from the app store and configured by application developers in the Now Platform with the features, functions, and details needed for your business. The same expectations you have for all your other mobile applications outside of work, now also apply to ServiceNow Mobile apps.

Top 10 reasons to use ServiceNow Mobile apps

- Persona-focused for intuitive use

- Mobile first and completely native, using the device's built-in features

- Codeless and rapid development of new applets

- Ability to submit, view, and update requests, issues, and tasks

- Global search to find people, service and items, and articles

- Offline access with Mobile Agent to enable fulfillers to complete work while not connected

- Push notifications for access to important information instantly

- Access to Virtual Agent, chat, and knowledge articles

- Role-based access to customized information

- Manageable from an MDM (mobile device management) or an MAM (mobile application management)

###### Service Portal

The Service Portal provides a user-friendly self-service experience, by providing access to specific features, using widgets. Users are able to:

- Search for articles, catalog items, records
- Submit requests
- Browse the corporate news feed
- And much more!

The Service Portal homepage can be accessed by navigating to https://<instancename>.service-now.com/sp. Your organization might have different ServiceNow instance environments for development, test, and production. Therefore, the <instancename> is the name of the specific ServiceNow instance you are connecting to for use. 

Both expert developers and beginners with the proper permissions can configure portals to create engaging experiences. Less technical users can make basic configuration changes to the UI, using Branding Editor and other components of Service Portal. More advanced users can edit and extend portals, pages, and widgets. Expert users can use the Widget Editor tool to write scripts to power a portal and even create rich web applications on the Now Platform.
